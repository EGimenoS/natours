### Natour

First project for the "Advanced CSS and SASS" course from Jonas Schmedtman.

In this project we build a landing page using:

Some of the advanced CSS techniques used here are:

- clip-path
- Keyframe animations
- Transition animations
- Use of ::after pseudo-element
- Use of background-clip
- Use of `backface-visibiliy` and `perspective`
- Use of background blend modes.
- Use of box-decoration-break
